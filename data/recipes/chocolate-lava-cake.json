    "The key to a perfect molten center is not overbaking. The edges should be set but the center should still jiggle slightly.",
    "Use high-quality chocolate (70% cocoa) for the best flavor and texture.",
    "These can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Add 1-2 minutes to baking time if baking from cold.",
    "Dust with powdered sugar just before serving for an elegant presentation."

    {
      "question": "Can I make these in advance?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can prepare the batter and fill the ramekins up to 24 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated and add 1-2 minutes to the baking time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't have ramekins?",
      "answer": "You can use muffin tins instead, but reduce the baking time to 8-10 minutes and watch carefully for doneness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when they're done?",
      "answer": "The edges should be firm and slightly pulling away from the sides, but the center should still look soft and jiggle when gently shaken."
