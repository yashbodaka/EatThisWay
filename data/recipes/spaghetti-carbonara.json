    "Traditional carbonara doesn't use cream! The creaminess comes from the eggs and cheese.",
    "Work quickly when combining the hot pasta with the egg mixture to create a smooth sauce without scrambling the eggs.",
    "Use freshly grated cheese for the best flavor and texture.",
    "The key is to remove the pan from heat before adding the egg mixture."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my carbonara look scrambled?",
      "answer": "The pan might be too hot when you add the eggs. Always remove from heat and toss quickly. The residual heat will cook the eggs into a creamy sauce."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use bacon instead of pancetta?",
      "answer": "Yes, but traditional carbonara uses guanciale or pancetta. Bacon will give a smokier flavor but works well as a substitute."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I reheat leftovers?",
      "answer": "Add a splash of pasta water or cream and reheat gently in a pan over low heat, tossing constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling."
    }
