    "Use the ripest tomatoes you can find for maximum flavor.",
    "Authentic Greek salad doesn't have lettuce - it's all about the vegetables and feta.",
    "Let the salad sit for 10-15 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.",
    "Use a block of feta cheese and break it into chunks rather than pre-crumbled feta for better texture."

    {
      "question": "Can I add lettuce to this salad?",
      "answer": "Traditional Greek salad (Horiatiki) doesn't include lettuce, but you can add it if you prefer. Use crisp romaine or iceberg."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will this keep?",
      "answer": "The salad is best eaten fresh, but you can prepare all the vegetables and store them separately from the dressing for up to 1 day. Dress just before serving."

    {
      "question": "What kind of olives should I use?",
      "answer": "Kalamata olives are traditional and provide the authentic flavor, but any good quality Greek olive will work."
