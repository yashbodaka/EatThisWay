    "Choose ripe but firm avocados for the best texture - they should yield slightly to gentle pressure.",
    "Add a drizzle of hot sauce or sriracha for an extra kick.",
    "For a vegan version, skip the poached egg and add extra toppings like hemp seeds or nutritional yeast.",
    "Toast the bread until it's crispy to prevent it from getting soggy."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my avocado is ripe?",
      "answer": "A ripe avocado should yield to gentle pressure but not feel mushy. The skin may be dark green to nearly black, and it should come away from the pit easily."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make this ahead?",
      "answer": "It's best enjoyed fresh, but you can mash the avocado with lemon juice up to 2 hours ahead. Keep covered with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface to prevent browning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What other toppings work well?",
      "answer": "Try feta cheese, smoked salmon, radish slices, everything bagel seasoning, or a drizzle of balsamic glaze."
